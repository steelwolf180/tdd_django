# Introduction
This is the project base for the TDD Django workshop. This repo includes Django, Pytest, Selenium & Geko driver for you 
to get started when you are using the `master` branch.

# Workshop Section 
Please checkout each branch based upon the changes for each section of the workshop in the slides that was given to you.
## Setup & Installation - "master" branch
For more information on how to setup & configure this project please refer to the link below:
[TDD Django workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_hoHAXffuHor32RzdPbpUIe912eSe1zf9IjUdiMTM8w/edit?usp=sharing)

## Pytest Basics - "pytest-basics" branch
In this chapter of the workshop you learn the basics of creating, executing and reading pytest

## Django Basics - "django-basics" branch
In this chapter of the workshop you learn what is MVT, creating & executing a unit test and functional test in Django.

## Create your Own ToDo List - "todo-list-starter" branch
In this section we will go into the meat of the workshop to tackle the features in this list. You are free to think of 
creating your own features, just remember to follow the TDD cycle while implementing it:
* ToDo List Style & Layout
* Creating a New Task
* Creating Updating Task
* Deleting a Task
* Input Validation
* Cleaning Data
* Validating Data
* Saving Data to Database
* Getting Data from the Database
* Formatting Data as Task List
* Display Data as a Task List

`Note` - `TDD` is free form by tackling a test case 1 at a time. Thus, the list of features that was shown 
I would expect for a ToDo list. 

## Completed ToDo List - "todo-list-complete" branch
This section is to make TDD easy for you in an event that you had encountered problems as reference on how I would 
solve the problem. I would suggest you to type out these code to help you to remember better than copy & pasting the code in 
this section of the workshop
